### 😎 About Me
I'm **Loede** — part human, part caffeine, and full-time overthinker turned coder.  
Currently trying to:
- Build cool stuff 💻  
- Debug life 🪲  
- Pretend I understand Kubernetes ☁️  

> “If it works on my machine, it works everywhere.” — ancient dev proverb

---

### 🧠 What I Know (or Pretend to Know)
`PHP` • `Laravel` • `JS` • `HTML/CSS` • `Livewire` • `MySQL`  
Sometimes I even close my tags properly. Sometimes.

---

### 🧩 Current Projects
- Building random ideas that may or may not see the light of production 🚧  
- Fixing bugs I created three commits ago 🐛  
- Staring at my screen until it compiles 🌀  

---

### ⚡ Fun Facts
- I talk to my code like it’s a person  
- “Just a quick fix” never ends quickly  
- Coffee is part of my CI/CD pipeline ☕  
- Tabs > Spaces (let’s fight)
